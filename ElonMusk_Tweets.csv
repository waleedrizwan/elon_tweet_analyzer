New SpaceX droneship will be called A Shortfall of Gravitas
Nothing can escape gravity not even black holes and they really tried
IDAACarmack Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while its driving

teslaownersSV SpaceX Vectorspace birds eye view coming with FSD
PPathole SpaceX Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
Erdayastronaut SpaceX All of that and more Were doing a broad review of launch site propulsion structures avionics range amp regulatory constraints this weekend I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person
alandail SpaceX Exactly
SpaceX We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year
lexfridman I agree with Lex
Mike94160775 Tesla ElectrekCo Teslarati Glad youre ok

tobyliiiiiiiiii RationalEtienne SPEXcast WilliamMBrown PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Oh yeah Starship update coming in about 3 weeks The design has coalesced What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V10 with almost no changes
RationalEtienne SPEXcast WilliamMBrown PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
SPEXcast WilliamMBrown RationalEtienne PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Great
WilliamMBrown RationalEtienne PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Brownsville is quite far south so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity  needs several more Starlink launches Im using it at the little house I rent in the area Definitely not good there yet
PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Average latency will improve as more satellites launch directly above you more frequently amp more ground stations are deployed As were able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers legacy Internet latency will be zero
tobyliiiiiiiiii RationalEtienne PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
RationalEtienne PPathole thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Yes Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
PPathole Erdayastronaut NASASpaceflight BocaChicaGal TheFavoritist Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker although filling up the ship in orbit isnt required for Mars so 4 is possible
thesheetztweetz waEMD SpaceX SpaceXStarlink WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
WholeMarsBlog MKBHD Yeah
AdlanBogatyryov Erdayastronaut NASASpaceflight BocaChicaGal TheFavoritist Great letter It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites as were actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine amp scientific progress is not impeded
Erdayastronaut NASASpaceflight BocaChicaGal TheFavoritist The ship rings are thicker than they need to be for now so same thickness works for booster amp ship for hoop stress Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling
MKBHD Its nextlevel

ValaAfshar Tesla Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
vmone1 waEMD SpaceX We will probably IPO Starlink but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth amp predictable Public market does not like erratic cash flow haha Im a huge fan of small retail investors Will make sure they get top priority You can hold me to it
PerezShivam waEMD SpaceX Fate loooves irony haha
waEMD SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help We are prioritizing emergency responders amp locations with no Internet connectivity at all
austinbarnard45 True
teslavibes Thats total market not all Tesla We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehiclesyear probably before 2030 but that requires consistently excellent execution
CashMoneyLemon CathieDWood skorusARK Total market
CathieDWood skorusARK Seven years for sure to 30M new fully electric vehicles per year six years maybe Five years is possible but unlikely An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials
flcnhvy CathieDWood Both will do original cars
CathieDWood We arent cutting the price of Model 3 to 25k I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3

flcnhvy Kristennetten Checking into it
Kristennetten Totally up to you but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you amp maybe help out new owners that would be cool
IDAACarmack Completely agree
Erdayastronaut Yes the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox No more hydraulics
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries For new owners we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics

flcnhvy NASASpaceflight austinbarnard45 PPathole Mostly 304L some 301 Broke at 301 to 304 interface SN9 will be all 304 Also were making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture
NASASpaceflight austinbarnard45 PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage 9 bar at base due to propellant head Its enough Improvements in work
PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps amp drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks Will do several flights to confirm working well then add heat shield amp go high Mach
First flight is to 15km or 50000 ft

PPathole Erdayastronaut There are some practical size constraints too Cant be too big to fit in the engine compartment But it could be a little bigger 380 sec Isp would be nice
PPathole Erdayastronaut Doesnt seem to be a problem We could probably increase area ratio given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure

umutcnbostanci Yes
teslaownersSV cgi irl
tobyliiiiiiiiii CARandDRIVER Tesla Haha
 CARandDRIVER We drove a Model S Long Range Plus for 4227 miles in California and believe we could have made it to 430 Tesla explain
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood Its 1000 to 10000 harder than making a few prototypes The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself
NASASpaceflight BocaChicaGal Haha
We intend to increase not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic LG amp CATL possibly other partners too However even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 amp beyond unless we also take action ourselves
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow This affects longterm production especially Semi Cybertruck amp Roadster but what we announce will not reach serious highvolume production until 2022
EvaFoxU Thanks
Neopork85 SpaceX MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship Theyre coming
Neopork85 SpaceX MarcusHouseGame Most likely all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability change in wind direction in which case one or more flaps will extend
Model3Owners Fine well do it already 
ARKInvest TashaARK Good analysis although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature

jgrano305 soumiksf IDAACarmack Its big
ZogFotPik samiralyateem IDAACarmack Sure
soumiksf IDAACarmack Yeah we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
samiralyateem IDAACarmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision This works well with neural nets but not with regular computing which expects extreme precision
soumiksf IDAACarmack Dojo uses our own chips amp a computer architecture optimized for neural net training not a GPU cluster Could be wrong but I think it will be best in world
llamaa35079089 IDAACarmack Tesla You really want waypoints this much
IDAACarmack For Dojo were betting on FP16 with floating floating point essentially truncating mostly zeroes so it feels like FP32 amp existing software just works We considered FP8 for a while but everyone hated it I even asked Twitter For inference int8 works great

teslaownersSV Model3Owners TrungTPhan Felt I had done enough on the Internet Zip2 amp PayPal that my work would be useful to others Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy amp making life multiplanetary
Model3Owners TrungTPhan It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX amp Tesla success probabilities above zero
TrungTPhan To be frank in the early days I thought there was gt90 chance that both SpaceX amp Tesla would be worth 0 The press amp aerospace  automotive industry at the time correctly agreed with me

Teslarati It will be very insane
Speedrunning Factorio in real life 
cleantechnica No but you make some great points Important to note that irons cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel That said iron alleviates much of the scaling problem

MatthewCable6 ErcXspace Just a guess but probably mid teens Booster amp stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors Well build several ships just to improve the production system
ErcXspace Pretty accurate simulation although SN8 will use 3 Raptors If SN8 craters SN9 amp SN10 are close behind High production rate allows for fast iteration
teslavibes Couldnt agree more  major software improvements are already in place to extend its life amp more coming
cleantechnica Definitely not Smartwatches amp phones are yesterdays technology Neuralinks are the future

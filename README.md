- Uses Tweepy API to automatically extract Elons tweets, requires API access from Twittwer developer community


- Sci-Kit Learn library to train a GaussianNB based ML Classifer to predict impacts on Tesla Stock price
caused by tweets made by CEO Elon Musk. This was created to demonstrate basic sentiment analysis and is 
fairly simple. I was able to train the model by manually labelling 200 tweets and feeding the tweet along with its 
sentiment into the GaussianNB object.
